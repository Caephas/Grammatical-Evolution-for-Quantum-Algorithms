# Grammatical Evolution for Quantum Circuits

This repository explores the use of **Grammatical Evolution (GE)** to evolve quantum circuits.

## Overview

Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a powerful evolutionary computation technique that evolves solutions using a grammar-based approach. In this project, we leverage GE to create and evolve quantum circuits, particularly targeting the Grover Search Algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm designed to solve unstructured search problems efficiently.

### Features

- Use of **Grammatical Evolution** to generate quantum circuits.
- Application of the evolved circuits to **Grover's Algorithm**.
- Integration with quantum computing frameworks like Qiskit.

### Repository Structure

- **`GE_Grover.ipynb`**: Main Jupyter notebook that implements the Grammatical Evolution process for generating quantum circuits for Grover's algorithm.
- **`parse_circuit.py`**: Python script for parsing and validating quantum circuits generated by the evolution process.
- **`test_parsing.ipynb`**: Notebook for testing and debugging circuit parsing and validation logic.
- **`.venv/`**: Virtual environment for running the project (ignored in `.gitignore`).
- **`Utilities/`**: Helper scripts and utilities (ignored in `.gitignore`).

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit
- Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
