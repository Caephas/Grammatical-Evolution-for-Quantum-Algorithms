# Grammatical Evolution for Quantum Circuits

This repository explores the use of **Grammatical Evolution (GE)** to evolve quantum circuits/algorithms.

## Overview

Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a powerful evolutionary computation technique that evolves solutions using a grammar-based approach. In this project, we leverage GE to create and evolve quantum circuits.

### Features

- Use of **Grammatical Evolution** to generate quantum circuits.
- Integration with Qiskit.

### Repository Structure

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- grape
- Qiskit
- Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
